A note about version numbers
----------------------------

Timeline uses a three-component version numbering system (X.Y.Z).

Z is only incremented when critical bugs are corrected or translations are
updated. The functionality of the program is the same for all X.Y versions.

Y is incremented every time a new feature or enhancement is added.

X is incremented when the new version is no longer compatible with previous
versions or when the program undergoes some big change or significant
milestone.
